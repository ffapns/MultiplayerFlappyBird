# Architecture
- [Ionic 2](https://ionicframework.com) & [Cordova](https://cordova.apache.org) - The hybrid application framework
- [Firebase](https://firebase.google.com) - Used for authentication, realtime database, cloud storage and hosting


# API
- [Phaser](http://phaser.io/) - Desktop & Mobile HTML5 Game Framework
- [AngularFire](https://github.com/angular/angularfire2) - The official library for Firebase and Angular

<h4>##What's coming next?</h4>

- Set your flappy name 
- Join the flappy game world
- Multiplayer
- Record your high scores
- Share the score to your friends

# Known issues and bugs
- Ionic doesn't support for the free phaser but if you want to, you have to buy 
[IonPhaser](https://market.ionicframework.com/plugins/ionphaser).
- So, this will cause a bug when you deploy on device which you can't get into the game section.
